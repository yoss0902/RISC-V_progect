In this project I'm attempting to write a RTL code using Verilog for a RISC-V
Single cycle proccessor.

The project consist of 100 Days, such as every day consist of one digital
component or stracture. in the construction of the advanced components and structures, the
previous component are been used.

The project was made with the help and the insperation of Rahul Behl which was the first to
do it and my thanks are given to him.
