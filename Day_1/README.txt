The Design:
	
	'a' is the '0' leg of the mux
	'b' is the '1' leg of the mux
	'sel' is the select wire
	'out' is the output of the mux

The Test Bench:
	
	in the TB i have simply generated random numbers for 'a' and 'b' from 
	number between 0 to 255, and a random number modulu 2 for the select.
	I have repeated this method 10 times to check that the mux is working 
	properly.
