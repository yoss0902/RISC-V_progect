In this project I am attempting to write a RTL code using Verilog to create a RISC-V
Single cycle proccessor.

The project is consist of 100 parts. each part consist of one digital
component or structure. In the proccess of creating the advenced and more
complex compenents, I make use of the previous components.  

For simulation and synthesis, I am using "EDA playground".

In the proccess of creating this project so far, I have recieved help and insperation from Rahul Behl
who created his own project of this sort, and i'd like to thank him.
